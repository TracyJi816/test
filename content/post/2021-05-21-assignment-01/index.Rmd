## Temperature vs Pressure
We will study the relationship between temperature and pressure through a density plot

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = datasets::pressure, aes(x = pressure, fill = temperature)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Pressure vs Temperature", 
    x = "Pressure (mercury in millimeters)", y = "Temperature (Celsius)",
    fill = "Temperature"
    )
```

* From the chart above we could easily found the temperature and pressure may have certain positive relation.

* However, we still need a larger sample to test our observations.
