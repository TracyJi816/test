<h2>1. Temperature vs Pressure</h2>
<p>We will study the relationship between temperature and pressure through a density plot</p>

<ul>
<li><p>From the chart above we could easily found the temperature and pressure may have certain positive relation.</p></li>
<li><p>However, we still need a larger sample to test our observations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We could also use another plot to do this data visualization:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = datasets::pressure, aes(x = pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = &quot;Pressure vs Temperature&quot;,
       x = &quot;Pressure(mercury in millimeters)&quot;,
       y = &quot;Temperature(Celsius)&quot;) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())</code></pre>

<div id="performances-among-different-insect-sprays" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Performances Among Different Insect Sprays</h2>
<p>We will study the counts of insects in agricultural experimental units treated with different insecticides through a ridge plot</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggridges)
ggplot(data = datasets::InsectSprays, aes(x = count, y = spray, fill = spray, color = spray)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = &quot;Counts of Insects of Different Insecticides&quot;, 
       x = &quot;Count(units)&quot;,
       y = &quot;Sprays&quot;,
       fill = &quot;Sprays&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-21-assignment-01/Xiao%20Ji_Assignment%2001_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>From the ridge plot we could find Spray F performs better than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Performances between Spray A and Spray B are quite similar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We could use another simple plot to show the above data:</p>

<p>Discussion:
By doing this assignment, I have practiced several plots to do data visualization and it’s quite interesting process for me to explore different plot types. However, I still think it is a bit harder for me to distinguish categorical and numerical data. So, I have tried so many data in datasets to find appropriate way to visualize them. The most difficult one I don’t know how to deal with is “HairColorEye” data, and hope to know how could we visualize such kind of data. Thanks!</p>
